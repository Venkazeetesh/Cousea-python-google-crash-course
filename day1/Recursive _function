# Here the function takes a input value of n as 7
# The goes to for loops and shows each and every element and then it goes to else block there 
# Here it specifies the return block with some specified condition,after that there is a variable name 
# It works like japanese doll complex problem will be break into subproblems using recursion
# But here it has major draw back it it takes more amount of memory then it useses
